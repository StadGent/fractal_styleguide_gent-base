# Theme footer

The theme footer shows specific contact information, newsletter subscription and/or social media links.

## When to use this component

* The web page is about a **specific City of Ghent theme** or the web page is part of a **separate website**.
* The City of Ghent theme or separate website has specfic contact information, newsletter subscription and/or social media links specific for that City of Ghent theme or that separate website.

When these conditions apply, the theme footer can be used on all types of pages about the specific City of Ghent theme or on all types of pages on the separate website.

If used, the theme footer should always be placed just above the general footer.

1. Contact information specific for the City of Ghent theme or separate website
2. Newsletter subscription for specific newsletters for the City of Ghent theme or separate website
3. Social media links to specific social media channels of the City of Ghent theme or separate website

Each of these components can only *once* be present in the theme footer.
