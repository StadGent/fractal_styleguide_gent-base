# Summary

## When to use this component

Use the summary component on detail pages to highlight the data that you want users to remember after they've seen the page.

The summary component works best:

* To highlight **a key takeaway or a short conclusion**. Remember, keep it short, you want users to remember it. The ideal length is the length of a tweet, meaning between 140 characters and 280 characters.
* To present **metadata**, for instance:
  * On an event detail page: event date and location.
  * On a team member's detail page: job function and departement.
  * On a detail page about a book or publication: author, publication date, publisher, number of pages, language.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the summary component to show long text or complex content.

Do not use the summary component on overview or filter pages. Only use the summary component on detail pages.

## How it works

The summary component consists of 2 parts:

* A list containing the data.
* An optional call-to-action button, for instance to subscribe for an event on an event detail page
