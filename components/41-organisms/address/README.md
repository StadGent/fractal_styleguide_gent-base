# Address

## When to use this component

Use the address component to help users enter address details.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the address component for other uses than letting users enter address details.

## How it works

* The address component consists of <a href="{{path './form-item.html'}}">input components</a> to enter address details and a <a href="{{path './select.html'}}">select component</a> to select the country.
* The fields are grouped in a fieldset.
* The fieldset uses a legend to present a description for the address details fieldset. See the example.
* The required fields are: street, number, postal code, municipality and country. The mailbox field is optional.

## Usage, behavior, layout and validation

The address component is a form element that should always be used in a form. For a description of the usage, the behavior, the layout and validation of form elements, see the <a href="{{path './form.html'}}">form component examples and documentation</a>.
