## How to use this component

The document box should be placed just after the page contents.

If there is also a <a href="{{path './contact-box.html'}}">contact box</a> and/or a <a href="{{path './related-box.html'}}">related box</a> on the page, the order of the boxes should be the following:

1. Contact box
2. Document box
3. Related box

If the page is a news article page with related articles, the <a href="{{path './extra-articles.html'}}">extra articles</a> component should be following right after.
