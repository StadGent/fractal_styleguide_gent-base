# The address organism

This organism is composed of multiple form item molecules such as textfields,
number fields and select lists. Because the default layout of form items is a
50% width field with an optional information box next this organism changes the
default styling of its molecules a bit more extensively.

All form-item molecules in this organism are 100% in width unless otherwise
specified. This makes it possible to display inline form elements. This is used
by this component to float the street, number and box number fields on one line.
