# Footer

## When to use this component

All websites and all pages must include the footer.

## How it works

The footer component is the last visible component on every page. The position of the footer is fixed on the page.

The footer is fully responsive and shows the same content and functionalitiy on all screen resolutions.

The footer component contains the following elements:

* Gentinfo contact information
* Useful links
* Social media links
* Legal links
* Mention of Digipolis

The Gentinfo contact information in itself contains the following elements:

* A spot illustration
* The Gentinfo typologo
* Introduction to Gentinfo
* Gentinfo telephone number with tel-link
* Gentinfo e-mail address with mailto-link
* Link to the Gentinfo contact form
* Chat function

## Requirements

The footer always refers to the City of Ghent in a general level.

Within a website, the footer always stays the same.

In the footer component, the following elements can vary per website:

* The useful links. They can be selected per website. There can be more or less of them and they can link to specific websites or pages that are relevant for that website.
* The chat function ("Chat with Gentinfo") can be omitted. This is a functional decision specific for the website.

All other elements in the footer are fixed and should be included *as is*. The Gentinfo contact information, social media links, legal links and the mention of Digipolis should stay the same for every website using the City of Ghent Style Guide. Also the style and the layout cannot be changed in anyway. In the examples the footer component is shown as it should be included in different languages.

## Usage

* This organism must be included in a top-level footer landmark.
* It can be preceded by the theme-footer section.
