# Footer

## Grid implementation

The Stad Gent footer can be used in 3 possible ways, as a:

* 2 column layout
* 3 column layout
* 4 column layout

All versions are fully responsive and should be triggered based on the
data-columns attribute on the wrapping div.

For example:

```html
<footer class="section--wrapper" role="contentinfo" data-columns="4">
```

Will result in a footer with 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet and 1
column on mobile.

It is explicitly forbidden to use less then 2 or more then 4 columns in this
footer organisme!

## Components and examples

Components in the footer should be as defined by the styleguide.
Examples of 2, 3 or 4 column layouts can be viewed in the style guide.
