# Summary

## When to use this component

Use the summary component on detail pages to highlight the data that you want users to remember after they've seen the page.

For instance, the summary component can be used for a short summary, a key takeaway or short conclusion. Remember, keep it short, you want users to remember it. When using text, the summary component works best when using a piece of text with the length of a tweet, meaning between 140 characters and 280 characters.

For detail pages or content that typically has some important metadata, use the summary component to show this metadata, for instance:

* On an event detail page: event date and location.
* On a team member's detail page: job function and departement.
* On a detail page about a book or publication: author, publication date, publisher, number of pages, language.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the summary component to show long text or complex content.

Do not use the summary component on overview or filter pages. Only use the summary component on detail pages.

## How it works

The summary component consists of three parts:

* A spot illustration
* A container where to put the data to highlight
* An optional call-to-action button, for instance to subscribe for an event on an event detail page
