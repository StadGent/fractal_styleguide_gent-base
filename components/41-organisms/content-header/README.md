# Content header

The content header displays the page title in a specific way for different content types.

Use the content header when the following conditions apply:

* The web page is
  * a generic info page
  * a news/event page
  * a form page
  * a theme page
  * a topic overview page

When these conditions apply, the content header can be used.

If used, the content header should always be placed just below the general header.

1. Readspeaker (optional)
2. Page title
3. Page summary text (optional)
4. Image (optional)
