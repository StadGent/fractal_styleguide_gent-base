# Header

## When to use this component

All websites and all pages must include the header.

## How it works

The header is the first visible component on every page. The position of the header is fixed on the page.

The header is shown and behaves in two different ways depending on the device's screen resolutions:

* **Desktop header**: Desktop resolutions and tablet in landscape mode
* **Mobile header**: Tablet in portrait mode and mobile resolutions

### Desktop header

The desktop header is used on desktop resolutions and tablets in landscape mode.

The desktop header can consist of four parts:

1. Top header with Ghent logo (always required)
2. Menu with main navigation (optional)
3. Breadcrumbs (required for most websites)
4. Header image (optional)

The top header with Ghent logo has the following components:

* Ghent logo (always required)
* Site title (optional, only for separate websites)
* Search (optional, only if applicable)
* Mijn Gent (optional, only if applicable)
* Language switch (optional, only for multilingual websites with synchronous translations)

When there is no header image, the light blue Ghent-style seperator is shown. When there is a header image, the light blue Ghent-style separator is not shown.

**Further specific requirements for the City of Ghent website and for separate websites are listed below.**

### Mobile header

The mobile header is used on tablet in portrait mode and below (mobile resolutions).

The mobile header can consist of three parts:

1. Top header with Ghent logo (always required)
2. Site title (optional, only for separate websites)
3. Breadcrumbs (required for most websites)

The top header with Ghent logo has the following components:

* Ghent logo (always required)
* Search button with link (optional, only if applicable)
* Mijn Gent (optional, only if applicable)
* Menu button (optional, only if applicable)
* Language switch (optional, only if applicable and for multilingual websites with synchronous translations)

For the top part of the mobile header, the following conditions apply:

1. Where there is a header image, the header image in the mobile header is hidden. The light blue Ghent-style separator is always shown.

2. When the website has a search function, the search function is always shown in the header.

3. When the website has main navigation, the menu button is always shown in the header. The menu button opens the mobile menu with the main navigation.

4. When the website has main navigation and also Mijn Gent and/or a language switch, Mijn Gent and/or the language switch are intergrated in the menu. The menu button is always shown in the header. The menu button opens the mobile menu with the main navigation and Mijn Gent and/or the language switch.

Taking the above conditions into account, only the following combinations of elements are possible in the top part of the mobile header:

* Ghent logo + Search button + Menu button
* Ghent logo + Search button + Language switch
* Ghent logo + Search button + Mijn Gent
* Ghent logo + Search button
* Ghent logo + Mijn Gent
* Ghent logo + Language switch
* Ghent logo + Menu button
* Ghent logo + Mijn Gent + Language switch
* Ghent logo only
