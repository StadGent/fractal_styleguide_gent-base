# Pagination

Pagination has a few required elements:

* A first link.
* A previous link.
* A Next link.
* A last link.
* An ellipsis between the previous link and the first available next page number.
* An ellipsis between the next link and the first available previous page number.

The examples here should give you enough context to implement a pagination in
your own website or application.
