# Hamburger menu

## General

In the styleguide a hamburger menu on desktop is allowed.
The context of the implementation of this styleguide should specify
when a hamburger is rendered (eg. the organism which uses the hamburger-
menu molecule).

This means that the Hamburger-menu cannot define its responsive
behaviour on it self but only in relation to a bigger organism.

## Javascript

This is a Javascript enabled molecule. Please check the [javascript documentation]
(../../docs/javascript) on how to implement this correctly in your project.
