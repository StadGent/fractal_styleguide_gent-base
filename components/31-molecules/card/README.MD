# Card

The card component is a generic box containing atomic information and possible actions.

## When to use this component

Use cards to provide information and or actions on specific items.  
For instance place each article of a shopping basket in a card, together with actions to remove,
duplicate, adjust said item.

## When not to use this component

Do not use cards as a way to highlight a specific aspect of a bigger set of information. 
Use the highlight component for that. The content of cards should always be atomic.
