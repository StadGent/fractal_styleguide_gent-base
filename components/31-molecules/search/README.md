# Search

The search component is a small form with a textfield and a search button used to trigger the search function of a website.

## When to use this component

Use the search component on websites that have a search function to offer search functionality on any web page where it is wanted.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the search component on websites that don't have a search function.

## How it works

The search component is a small form with:

* A textfield where the user can enter one or more search keywords.
* A search button, which is the submit buttom of the form.

When clicking the search button, the search function of the website is triggerd. Typically, the user is brought to a search results page.

## Usage within the style guide

The search component is used in the <a href="{{path './header'}}">header</a> component. Here, as an exception, the textfield has a placeholder instead of label, because in the header component, a label is not possible.
