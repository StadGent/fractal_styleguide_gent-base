# Search

The search molecule can be used in many different contexts. One example could be
<a href="{{path './header'}}">the header organisme</a> of the City of Ghent.

It never has a placeholder, as defined by the style guide for all input types.
One exception is inside <a href="{{path './header'}}">the header organisme</a>,
where a label is not possible and it does need a placeholder.
