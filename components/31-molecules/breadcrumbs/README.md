# Breadcrumbs

## General

Breadcrumbs are used to show website users their current location relative to higher-level sections, helping them to understand where they are in relation to the rest of the web site. They also afford one-click access to higher web site sections and to the home page of the web site.

## When to use

Breadcrumbs should always be used on all web sites.

## Where to use

Breadcrumbs should be used:

* On every web page of the web site except the home page.
* On all resolutions (desktop, tablet and mobile).

## Composition

Breadcrumbs are composed as follows:

1. They start with a link to the home page. This link always links to the home page of the **current website** where the website user is (see some examples below). **This link should always have the label "Home".**
2. After that the higher-level sections relative to the current web page are shown using links to each of these sections.
3. They end with the page title of the current page. This is not a link.

Examples for the link to the home page:

* On the City of Ghent general web site, including theme sites, the breadcrumbs starts with "Home" and links to the home page of the City of Ghent general web site.
* On a separate web site, the breadcrumbs also starts with "Home" and links to the corresponding home page of that separate web site.
