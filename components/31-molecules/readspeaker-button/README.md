# Text to speech button

Use text to speech to let users listen to the content of web pages.

## When to use this component

When the website has a text so speech ability, use the text to speech button to let the user trigger the text to speech function to read the content on the current web page out loud.

The text to speech button should be enabled on:

* Desktop resolutions (not on tablet nor on mobile)
* Detail pages only

## When not to use this component

When the website has a text to speech ability, the text to speech button should *not* be enabled on:

* Mobile and tablet resolutions
* Overview pages and filter pages

If the website requires the text to speech button anyway, this can of course be overruled and the text to speech button can be placed on any page and on any resolution where it is required.

## How it works

The text to speech button triggers the text to speech ability of the website to read the content of the current web page out loud so that users can listen to the page.

Depending on the text to speech solution that is used in the website, the behavior can be different.

The text to speech button should always be placed just below the Heading 1.
