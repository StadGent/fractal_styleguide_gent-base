# Main menu

## General

The main menu has three major functions:
1. Affords one-click access to website users to top tasks and/or the main sections of the website.
2. Offers to website users an overview of the main sections of the website, helping them understand what the website is about and what they can find or do on the website.
3. Shows to website users in what main section of the website they are.

## When and where to use

A main menu should always be used on all websites.

There are only 2 possible exceptions to this standard rule:
1. Websites that only have 1 main section. In this case a main menu should not be used.
2. Websites that have a lot of main sections and where the number of sections cannot be reduced even with an optimized information architecture. In this case a main menu is not the best choice. For this kind of websites, it's better to rely on overview pages.

## Where to use

If used, the main menu should be accessible:
* On all pages of the website.
* On all resolutions (desktop, tablet and mobile).

## Composition

A main menu is composed as follows:

1. A set of links that can be selected/active (to show to website users in what main section of the website they are). Only one link at a time can be selected/active.
2. The first item is a link to the front page of the website. In most cases, this is the page called the home page. This is shown using the label "Home". In some special cases, when the front page is not a general home page, but has a more specific goal or specific content, the label can be something else than "Home". However, this is an exception.
