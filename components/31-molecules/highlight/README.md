# Highlight

## When to use this component

Use the highlight component on web pages to highlight a short text or to show a notification.

The highlight component works best with a text with no more than one or a few sentences. The ideal total length of the text is the length of a tweet, meaning between 140 characters and 280 characters.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the highlight component to show long text or complex content.

Do not use the highlight component to highlight a quote or a part of a quote. In this case, use the <a href="{{path './quote.html'}}">quote component</a> instead.

Do not use the highlight component to highlight **a key takeaway or a short conclusion**, to present **metadata** or when a call-to-action button is required. In these cases, use the <a href="{{path './summary-box.html'}}">summary component</a> instead.

## How it works

The highlight component consists of two parts:

* A spot illustration
* A short text or notification text

## Layout

The highlight component has two different layouts that can be used:

* Spot illustration on the left
* Spot illustration at the top right corner

On **tablets in portrait mode and mobile resolutions**, the spot illustration is always shown in the center at the top.
