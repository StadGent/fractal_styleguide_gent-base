# Quote

## When to use this component

Use the quote component to highlight a short quote or a part of a quote on detail pages. The quote component can also be used to highlight a short statement or conclusion also mentioned in the content of the detail page, like in a traditional news paper article.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the quote component for long quotes or text. The quote component works best when using quotes with the length of a tweet, meaning between 140 characters and 280 characters. For long or quotes, use a normal text <a href="{{path './paragraph.html'}}">paragraph</a>.

## How it works

The quote component consist of the following required elements:

* A fixed spot illustration to indicate this is a quote.
* The text of the short quote itself (or a part of the quote, a short statement, a conclusion,...)
* The person that said the quote or the source of the quote.
