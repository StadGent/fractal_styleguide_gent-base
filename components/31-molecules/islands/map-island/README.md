# Map block

The example styling is based on a default implementation of an Open Layers based
map. As a result our selectors and SASS are not as clearly as envisioned.

Use the styling in this styleguide as an example or use it in conjunction with
the gent_base_theme and the dg_maps module (a closed source Drupal 8 module
developed at Digipolis Gent) to achieve optimal results.

The styling will be refactored, in sync with subsequent releases of the DG Maps
module.
