# Partner block

## When to use this component

Use the partner block to present a set of logos of partners, organizations or companies that are related to a web page or a web site.

Example usages of the partner block are:

* Presenting partners or organizations that support the topic of the web page or web site.
* Presenting the entity or organization that is reponsible about the topic of a specific web page.
* Presenting sponsors.
* Presenting clients or references.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the partner block to present a set of images. In this case, use the <a href="{{path './image-gallery.html'}}">image gallery component</a> or the <a href="{{path './image-wall.html'}}">image wall component</a> instead.

## How it works

The partner block contains the following elements:

* An optional title.
* An optional short introduction text.
* One or more logos of partners, organizations or companies.

Each logo of a partner, organization or company can optionally link to another web page or web site. Typically, this will be the web page or web site of the partner, organization or company.

The partner block works best:
* When it is placed at the bottom of the content of web pages.
* When the logos of the partners, organizations or companies are SVGs with a transparant background and are unicolor using one of the Style Guide <a href="{{path './colors.html'}}">colors</a>.
