# Input

## When to use this component

Use the input component to let users enter text or a value that is not longer than a single line.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the input component to let users enter longer text that might have multiple lines. In this case, use <a href="{{path './textarea.html'}}">textarea component</a> instead.

## How it works

### Types of input

* Default (simple text or text value that is not longer than a single line, no format)
* Date (date format)
* Number (number format)
* Password (password, characters are masked)
* Email (automatically validated)
* Telephone number

## Usage, behaviour, layout and validation

The input component is a form element that should always be used in a form. For a description of the usage, the behavior, the layout and validation of form elements, see the <a href="{{path './form.html'}}">form component examples and documentation</a>.
