# Select

## When to use this component

Use the select component to let users select one option and no more from a long list of options.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the select component when there are better alternatives than using a select component.

* When possible, reduce and simplify the list of options to present fewer options to the user.
* When users should only be able to select one option and no more, try to use the <a href="{{path './radios.html'}}">radios component</a> instead.

Do not use the select component when you need to help users:

* Select one or more options.
* Toggle a single option on or off.

In these cases, use the <a href="{{path './checkboxes.html'}}">checkboxes component</a> (for a single option or a short list of options) or the <a href="{{path './checkboxes-with-filter.html'}}">checkboxes with filter component</a> (for a long list of options) instead.
