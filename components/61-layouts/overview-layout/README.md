# Overview layout

The overview layout is a one-column layout with one wide column.

## When to use this layout

Use the overview layout to show an overview of content and to link to content in the overview.

The overview page typically uses a <a href="{{path './collection.html'}}">collection</a> of <a href="{{path './teaser.html'}}">teasers</a> to show the overview of the content and link to the detail pages about the content.

Examples of overview pages of content:

* A page with an overview of general, informational pages about a certain specific topic.
* A news articles overview page.
* An events overview page.
