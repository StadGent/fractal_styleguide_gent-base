# Fonts

## Default text font

The style guide uses the Google font "Fira Sans" for all text.
This gets loaded in the `_fonts.scss` SASSS partial through a SASS `@import` 
statement.

## The Ghent icon font

We also created our own icon font which gets loaded by an `@font-face` rule in 
`_icons.scss` SASS partial. This icon font is generated by using the following
gulp plugins:

* gulp-iconfont
* gulp-iconfont-css

This allows us to define a SASS partial template, which you can find in 
`_icons_template.template`. 

## Available mixins and classes

In the `_icons.scss` SASS partial you can find all the generated icon font SCSS
code you need to use an icon in your twig / html templates or in SASS by using
the `icon` mixin provided.

### Example of using the `icon` mixin to add an icon before an element.

```scss
  @include icon('uEA01-arrow-down', 'after');
```
