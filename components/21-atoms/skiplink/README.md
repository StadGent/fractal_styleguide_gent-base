# Skip Link

Use the skip link component to help keyboard-only users skip to the main content on a page.

## When to use this component

All pages must include a skip link in the header.

## How it works

Some people rely on keyboards to access a web page and to navigate through the links and elements on a web page.

Including the skip link component gives those users the option to bypass the top-level navigation links and jump to the main content on a page.

The skip link component is visually hidden until a keyboard press activates it.

## Web accessibility

Including a skip link on every page is a requirement for web accessibility:

The skiplink:
* Must be the first focusable element.
* Redirects to the main content.
