# Form label

## UX & accessibility

A form label tells the user what the corresponding input field means.

* Use short and descriptive form labels so users can quickly scan your form.
* Form labels should be top aligned to their corresponding input fields.
* All form elements must have a form label.
* Form labels are visually and syntactically related to the form element.
