# Link

## When to use this component

A link is used to trigger navigation. A link is used to link a web page (internal or external link) or a document (document link). A link can also be used to link to an e-mail address (mailto link).

## When not to use this component

Do not use a link to trigger an action. In this case, use a <a href="{{path './button.html'}}">button</a>.

## How it works

Both internal and external links open in the same window by default. **Exceptions** are non-web dcuments (pdf, doc, etc.) and print-friendly versions.

## Web accessibility

* A link should always look like a link.
* If a link receives a button style, the distinction between a button is conveyed visually.
