# Headings

## General

Headers create structure.
They provide a quick way to scan the main sections of a website.

* Make sure the headline works out of context.
* Use sentence case for headings.
* Headings have no closing punctuation, with the exception of question marks for
 questions.
* At least one paragraph of content should follow each heading.
* Headings of the same weight should never directly follow one another.
* Don’t use links in page headings.
* Use only one H1 per page.
* Don’t skip headings: e.g. do not jump from H1 to H3.

## Variants
There a few title variants available in style guide.

- **Overview titles:** Can be used above an overview, mostly as the page title.
  This variant is always styled as a heading 1.
- **Collection titles:** Can be used above a collection of teasers or tiles.
  This variant is always styled as a heading 2.

Simply add the title class on any heading element (according SEO guidelines) to
apply this style. It isn't required to use these classes on the default heading
element provided.

## Web accessibility

* Headings are visually and syntactically connected to their content.
