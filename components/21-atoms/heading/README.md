# Heading

## When to use this component

Headings create structure. They provide a quick way to scan the main sections of a website.

## How it works

* Use only one heading 1 (h1) per page.
* Don’t skip headings: e.g. do not jump from H1 to H3.
* Headings of the same weight should never directly follow one another.
* At least one paragraph of content should follow each heading.
* Use sentence case for headings.
* Headings have no closing punctuation, with the exception of question marks for
 questions.
* Don’t use links in page headings.

## Variants

There a few style variants for headings:

* **Overview title:** Style variant that can be used above an overview, mostly as the page title. This variant is always styled as a heading 1 (h1).
* **Collection title:** Style variant that can be used above a collection of teasers or tiles. This variant is always styled as a heading 2 (h2)

Simply add the title class on any heading element (according SEO guidelines) to
apply this style. It isn't required to use these classes on the default heading
element provided.

## Web accessibility

* Headings should be visually and syntactically connected to their content.
