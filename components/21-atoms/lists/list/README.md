# Lists

Lists organize information. Lists are meant to behave in a certain way:

* Use ordered lists when you need to display text in some ranking or hierarchy.
* Use unordered lists to display information with no specific order.
* A list must always consist of two or more items, never a single item.
* A link in a list starts with a chevron.
