# Label

## UX & accessibility

A label tells the user what the corresponding input field means.

* Use short and descriptive labels so users can quickly scan your form.
* Labels should be top aligned to their corresponding input fields.
* All form elements must have a label.
* Labels are visually and syntactically related to the form element.
