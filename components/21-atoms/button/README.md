# Button

## When to use this component

A button is used to trigger an action.

## When not to use this component

Do not use a button to trigger navigation. In this case, use a <a href="{{path './link.html'}}">link</a>.

## How it works



## Web accessibility

* Button elements trigger an action and always look like buttons.
* Link elements trigger navigation and look like links.
* If links receive a button style, the distinction between button elements
  is conveyed visually.
* State changes are not indicated by color alone.
