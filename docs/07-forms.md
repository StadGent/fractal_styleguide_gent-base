## Input fields 

### UX / Accessibility 

* Adjust the width of your form fields so it matches the length of the expected input, e.g. make a zip code field shorter.
* Avoid placeholders. They can be misinterpreted as already filled-in values and they are ignored by some read speakers.
* You can help users by pre-populating fields with the most common value.
* Don’t use defaults for input fields that require user attention. e.g. don’t sign the user up to a newsletter.
* If you validate an input field, delay the validation so that you don’t show error messages while the user is still filling in the field.
* On mobile :use the right keyboard to match the input data you need.
